        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've lived in the Lansing area since the third grade. I've lived in the city itself since 2000 -- for several years on the east side, for a decade in the Turner Dodge neighborhood, and now back on the eastside. My son came up through the Lansing School District, graduating from Lansing Eastern in 2019.</p>
​
<p>I've worked in state government for over 15 years, with significant experience in policy analysis, planning and evaluation, and program re-engineering. I currently serve as one of Lansing's representatives on the board of the Capital Area District Libraries and as a steering member of the Lansing Rent is Too Damn High coalition.</p>
​
<p>I believe in the power of community-driven change and the importance of an inclusive, equitable future for all of us. Our city is rich with diverse voices. I want to encourage community participation in our city's government and to ensure that all residents are heard and represented, regardless of background or circumstance. </p>

<p>Lansing can be a city for <b>all</b> of us. </p>
