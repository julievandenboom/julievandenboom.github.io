                    <p style="page-break-before: always; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">I raised my family in Lansing.</p>
                    <p>I've been in the Lansing area since the third grade. I've lived in the city itself since 2000 -- for several years on the Eastside, for a decade in the Turner Dodge neighborhood, and now back on the Eastside. My son came up through the Lansing School District, graduating from Lansing Eastern in 2019.</p>
                    <br class="small-break">
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">I am working to create a more livable community.</p>
                    <p>I've worked in state government for over 15 years, with significant experience in policy analysis, planning and evaluation, and program re-engineering. I currently serve as one of Lansing's representatives on the board of the Capital Area District Libraries and I'm an active member of Lansing Rent is Too Damn High.</p>
                    <br class="small-break">
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">I believe in the power of community-driven change to create an inclusive, equitable future for all of us.</p>
                    <p>Our city is rich with diverse voices. As an at-large council representative, it will be my privilege and responsibility to hear and represent every resident’s concerns. I will work with council members, local business, individuals, and civic organizations to create community-driven change. By working together, we will deliver solutions to forge an inclusive, equitable future for all of us, regardless of background or circumstance.</p>
                    <br class="small-break">
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Lansing is a city for <b>all</b> of us.</p>
