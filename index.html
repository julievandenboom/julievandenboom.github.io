               <p align="left">I've been in the Lansing area since the third grade. I've lived in the city itself since 2000 -- for several years on the east side, for a decade in the Turner Dodge neighborhood, and now back on the eastside. My son came up through the Lansing School District, graduating from Lansing Eastern in 2019.</p>
               <br> <p align="left">I've worked in state government for over 15 years, with significant experience in policy analysis, planning and evaluation, and program re-engineering. I currently serve as one of Lansing's representatives on the board of the Capital Area District Libraries and I'm a steering member of the Lansing Rent is Too Damn High coalition.</p>
               <br> <p align="left">I believe in the power of community-driven change and the importance of an inclusive, equitable future for all of us.
                    Our city is rich with diverse voices. I met many of you when I knocked on thousands of doors during the 2024 city charter commission election. I want to encourage community participation in our city's government and to ensure that all residents are heard and represented, regardless of background or circumstance.</p>
               <br>  <p align="left">Lansing is a city for <b>all</b> of us.</p><br>
